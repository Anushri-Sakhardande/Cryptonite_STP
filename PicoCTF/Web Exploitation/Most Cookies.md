## Problem
Alright, enough of using my own encryption. Flask session cookies should be plenty secure!

This was the provided script

This is the cookie
We have a flask cookie which we must decode.

Shows that the very -auth is blank to get the flag we must have admin there.
I looked up a writeup which used flask-usign to bruteforce the secret key based on the list in server.py

So the fortune is the secret key now we need to make our own cookie
