# It is my Birthday

## Problem
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.

I googled around to find a hash comparison. Hash comparison is a popular and fast method to check if two files have the same content. A hash function takes a file and generates a fixed-size string, a hash value, representing the file's content. If two files have the same hash value, they are almost certain to
have the same content.

[Found this site](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/) gave me two files with the same hash. There was also a hello.exe and erase.exe file on there, which I input, but I was prompted only to enter pdf.

So I changed them to pdf
I got the php of the site
